The most important parameter is the canvas obj, into which you should have already loaded an image.\n\nThis method returns an array of hashes, each representing a face, with the following fields:\n\n* `x`, `y` : the coordinates of the top-left corner of the face's bounding box\n* `width`, `height` : the pixel dimensions of the face's bounding box\n* `neighbours`, `confidence` : info from the detection algorithm\n\n### Simple example\n\n    var face_detect = require('face_detect'),\n        Canvas = require('canvas');\n    \n    // ... initialize a canvas object ...\n    \n    var result = face_detect.detect_objects({ \"canvas\" : myCanvas,\n      \"interval\" : 5,\n      \"min_neighbors\" : 1 });\n    \n    console.log('Found ' + result.length  + ' faces.');\n    \n    for (var i = 0; i < result.length; i++){\n      var face =  result[i];\n      console.log(face);\n    }\n    \n\nin future, directly passing an image path or a buffer containing raw png data will be supported\n\n# Credits\n\nIt's important to note that this is *not my work*. All credit for the actual face-detection work should go to [Liu Liu](https://github.com/liuliu/).\n\nI have just taken the browser JS from that project (in branch [current](https://github.com/liuliu/ccv/tree/current/js), plucked out the threading support and made it useable with node & npm via [node-canvas](https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/)\n\n# Install\n\nThis project is installed with [npm](http://npmjs.org).\n\n## from npm repository\n  \n    $cd my-project\n    $ npm install face-detect\n\n## locally with npm\n\n    $ git clone https://orls@github.com/orls/ccv-purejs.git face-detect\n    $ cd face-detect\n    $ npm install\n    $ cd ../my-project\n    $ npm install ../face-detect\n",
